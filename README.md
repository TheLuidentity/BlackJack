# BlackJack
First project developed years ago using Javascript, jQuery, and object oriented programming.

My first ever coding project that I made in 2014. It is a working blackjack program built in an object oriented style. The version here is the updated version 2 of the my blackjack program, with the added functionality oof split, doubledown, pile shuffle, riff shufle, cash implementation.

This project is currently hosted on a Amazon S3 server. Please feel free to give it a go!

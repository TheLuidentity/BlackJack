# BlackJack
First project developed years ago using Javascript, jQuery, and object oriented programming.

My first ever coding project that I made in 2014. It is a working blackjack program built in an object oriented style, it is missing some functionality (split, doubledown, etc) that has been implmented in version 2.

This project is currently hosted on a Amazon S3 server. Please feel free to give it a go!
